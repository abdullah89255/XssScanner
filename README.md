## 🚦 Usage  

### Step 1: Run the Script  
```bash
python xss.py  
```  

### Step 2 Directly URLs Scanning   
  ```bash
python3 xss_URLS_scan.py <urls_file> <payloads_file>
```

- `<urls_file>`: A text file containing URLs (one URL per line).
- `<payloads_file>`: A text file containing XSS payloads (one payload per line).

Command:
```bash
python3 xss_URLS_scan.py urls.txt payloads.txt
```

This will scan all URLs in `urls.txt` with payloads from `payloads.txt`. Let me know if you need further help!
